# RiskLens

A quantitative market risk dashboard that computes daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) across 12 major assets using five statistical models. Displayed in a dark quant-terminal UI with an S&P 500 historical risk chart dating back to 1990.

## What it shows

RiskLens answers one question every morning: **how much risk am I carrying right now, and is it getting worse?** It pulls yesterday's closing prices for 12 major assets and runs five statistical models to estimate how bad a bad day could get. The results land in a sortable table — click Risk to put the most stressed assets at the top — so you can see at a glance where pressure is building across equities, bonds, gold, crypto, and real estate.

- **Risk Gauge** — the most actionable number. Where does today's volatility sit relative to the past 2 years for that asset? 85% means risk is more elevated than 85% of recent history — not just high in absolute terms, but high *for that asset right now*.
- **VaR (Value at Risk)** — on a genuinely bad day (the worst 1% historically), how many dollars do you lose on a $100 position? Computed five different ways so you can see whether the models agree or disagree — that spread is itself a signal.
- **Expected Shortfall (ES)** — given it already is a bad day, how bad on average? Goes one step further than VaR by describing the full tail, not just where it starts.
- **Tail index (α)** — how fat are the tails? Lower = more extreme events possible than standard models assume. Useful for spotting assets where the VaR numbers may be underestimating true exposure.
- **S&P 500 historical chart** — 35+ years of daily risk estimates and annual returns with major crisis labels, so you can see where current volatility sits relative to the Dot-com crash, GFC, and COVID.
- **Cross-asset correlation chart** — rolling average pairwise correlation across 10 core ETFs since 2007. Shows when diversification is working and when it isn't.


## Data sources

### Where the data comes from

All price data is fetched via **[yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance)**, a Python library that wraps the Yahoo Finance public API.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Cost** | Free — no API key required |
| **Data type** | Daily adjusted closing prices (OHLCV, auto-adjusted for splits/dividends) |
| **Frequency** | Daily bars only — not intraday |
| **Lag** | Typically 1 business day. Running after ~4 PM ET gives you the previous day's close; running before market close gives you the prior day. |
| **History fetched** | 10 years for the 12 portfolio tickers; maximum available (back to 1927) for the S&P 500 historical chart |
| **Reliability** | Yahoo Finance is a best-effort free service. Occasional data gaps, ticker changes, or API outages can cause missing data. The backend forward-fills short gaps (e.g. BTC weekends vs equity holidays). |

### Tickers covered

| Ticker | Name | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| SPY | S&P 500 ETF | SPDR, most liquid US equity ETF |
| QQQ | Nasdaq 100 ETF | Invesco, large-cap tech |
| GLD | Gold ETF | SPDR, physically-backed |
| TLT | 20yr Treasury ETF | iShares, long-duration rates exposure |
| EEM | Emerging Markets ETF | iShares, broad EM equities |
| BTC-USD | Bitcoin / USD | Spot price, trades 24/7 |
| IWM | Russell 2000 ETF | iShares, US small-cap equities |
| HYG | High Yield Bond ETF | iShares, US junk bonds |
| LQD | Investment Grade Bond ETF | iShares, US IG corporate bonds |
| XLF | Financial Sector ETF | SPDR, US financials |
| VNQ | Real Estate ETF | Vanguard, US REITs |

### How data is fetched

Each ticker is downloaded individually (not in bulk) to avoid SQLite lock issues in yfinance's local cache. Gaps are forward-filled — this means Bitcoin's Sunday prices carry forward into Monday if equity markets are closed, keeping the return series aligned. The S&P 500 index (`^GSPC`) is fetched separately with the full available history for the historical chart.


## Risk models

Five models are computed for every ticker on every run, using a **1,000-day rolling window** of log returns.

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **HS** (Historical Simulation) | Empirical 1st percentile of the last 1,000 daily returns. No assumptions — just ranks actual history. Honest but slow to react to volatility regime changes. |
| **EWMA** | Exponentially Weighted Moving Average volatility (λ=0.94), assuming normally distributed returns. Weights recent days heavily — reacts quickly to volatility spikes. The industry standard for daily risk desks. |
| **GARCH(1,1)** | Models volatility as a mean-reverting process. Captures volatility clustering: bad days tend to follow bad days. Fit via the `arch` library. |
| **tGARCH** (GJR-GARCH) | Extends GARCH to treat negative shocks differently from positive ones. Empirically, bad news raises volatility more than equally-sized good news. More realistic for equity markets. |
| **EVT** (Extreme Value Theory) | Fits a Generalised Pareto Distribution to the tail of losses only. Most rigorous for rare, extreme events. Often materially higher than the others — that gap is a signal, not noise. |

All figures are **dollar loss on a $100 portfolio** at **1% confidence** (worst 1% of days).

**Risk Gauge** — percentile rank of today's EWMA VaR vs the trailing 2-year daily history of EWMA VaR for that ticker. 0% = historically calm, 100% = historically extreme for that asset.

**Tail index (α)** — Hill estimator on the return series. Equities typically sit around 3–4; values below 3 indicate meaningfully fatter tails than standard normal models assume.


## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kldgh/risklens.git
cd risklens
```

### 2. Python environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.lock.txt
```

> `requirements.lock.txt` has exact version pins for reproducibility.
> Use `requirements.txt` if you want loose bounds.

### 3. Generate risk data

```bash
python backend/run.py
```

Fetches ~10 years of price data and writes `frontend/public/data/risk_output.json`.
Takes ~30–60 seconds. Requires an internet connection.

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).


## GitHub Codespaces

Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace** on the repo page. The devcontainer installs all dependencies and auto-runs the backend + dev server on startup. The port 5173 preview opens automatically in your browser.


## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that:

1. Runs `python backend/run.py` to fetch fresh data
2. Builds the React frontend with `npm run build`
3. Deploys the static output to GitHub Pages

**Triggers:** every push to `main`, plus a daily cron at 6:30 AM UTC on weekdays (after US pre-market).

To enable: go to **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions** in your repo.
